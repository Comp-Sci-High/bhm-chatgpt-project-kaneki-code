                        Released in 2023, Read This When You Wake Up. serves as a reflective, late-night listen that showcases Sleepy Hallow’s evolution beyond drill. The EP leans into melancholic storytelling, capturing themes of pain, success, and relationships over moody, atmospheric production. Songs like "Pain Talk" highlight his struggles with fame and personal demons, while "Good Girls Ain’t No Fun" brings a smoother, more melodic approach. Despite its short length, the project solidifies Sleepy’s ability to balance vulnerability with street sensibility, making it a compelling listen.
